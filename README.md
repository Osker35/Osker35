# **Hi there, I'm Emre Sudi Ulker\! 👋**

I'm a Computer Science student at McMaster University and a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for creative problem-solving. From a young age, I've been fascinated by the intricate dance of digital security, which led me to a career in penetration testing. There's nothing more satisfying than discovering a critical vulnerability before the bad guys do.  
🛡️ **My Ethical Hacking Philosophy**  
I believe in a proactive and creative approach to security. It's not just about running scanners and ticking boxes; it's about thinking like an adversary, understanding their motives, and creatively chaining together seemingly low-impact vulnerabilities to uncover major threats. My goal is to provide actionable insights that empower organizations to strengthen their defenses in a meaningful way.
